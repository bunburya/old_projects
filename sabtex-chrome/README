Sabtex is a Simple Apertium-Based Translation EXtension.

The aim is to provide a convenient interface for translating specific words
or pieces of text on a web page using the Apertium web service.

This is the version for Google Chrome and Chromium. There are also plans to
develop a version for Firefox.

It is still a work in progress and will be packaged soon.
