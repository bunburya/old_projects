        <h1>Sabtex FAQ</h1>
        <p>
        <h2>How does Sabtex work?</h2>
        Sabtex works by detecting when you hover your mouse over a word or a highlighted piece
        of text, and querying the Apertium web service for the appropriate translation. When
        the translation is received it appears in a small non-intrusive popup box next to the
        text.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h2>What is Apertium?</h2>
        Apertium is an open-source translation platform. More information can be found
        <a href="http://www.apertium.org/?id=whatisapertium&lang=en">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h2>How do I configure Sabtex?</h2>
        You configure Sabtex by specifying a list of rules to govern its behaviour. A rule
        is a regular expression designed to capture a certain class of URLs, and an associated
        language pair (the languages to translate to and from). The rules can be changed on the
        options page. If a URL matches multiple rules, the one highest on the list will be used.
        For example, the regular expression <code>^http(s?):\/\/[^\s\/]+\.es(\/[\S])?</code> will
        match any URL where the domain name ends in ".es".
        </p>
        <p>
        If you don't want to use regular expressions to set different rules for different forms
        of URL, then simply add one rule, leaving the "URL" field blank, and set your desired
        source and target languages. Leaving the "URL" field blank makes that rule apply to
        all websites.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h2>Sabtex isn't translating this text properly.</h2>
        Sabtex itself doesn't handle any of the translation business; that is handled by Apertium,
        which is developed separately. Machine translation of natural languages is a difficult
        thing to do, and although Apertium is improving all the time it is inevitable that you
        will get many imperfect translations. Often if Sabtex provides a translation you know to
        be wrong, it can help to highlight the surrounding text and translate that as a whole,
        as the surrounding words may give Apertium a clue as to the context and correct
        translation of the word you're looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h2>Which languages are supported?</h2>
        When you try to select a source language on the options page, the target language dropdown
        box will only display languages to which Apertium can translate from that language.
        </p>
        <p>
        Sabtex should support the same languages that are supported by the web interface to Apertium,
        which can be accessed <a href="http://www.apertium.org/">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h2>Sabtex has messed up the look of a webpage.</h2>
        Sabtex works by manipulating the HTML of a webpage. Unfortunately, this will occasionally
        interfere with the look or behaviour of a webpage in ways that weren't intended and aren't
        desirable. Where you want to reverse the effects of Sabtex on a webpage, currently the only
        way to do this is to turn Sabtex off and refresh the webpage.
